# CPS1011-Programming Principles in C Assignment

The repository includes 2 folders:<br />
1.Question1Assignment: which contains all the files for Question 1<br />
2.Question2Assignment: which contains all the files for Question 2

## Question1Assignment
There are no prerequisites for running this program apart from importing the CMakeLists.txt,functionClass.c,functionClass.h and main.c files which are found in the Question1Assignment directory.

<br />1.CmakeLists.txt is required to run the program
<br /><br />2.functionClass.c contains the relevant methods
<br /><br />3.functionClass.h contains the declarations for the relevant methods
<br /><br />4.main.c contains the Main menu 

<br /><br />The directories .idea and cmake-build-debug are irrelevant if the user is not using CLion as an IDe.


## Question2Assignment
### Task2a)
The prerequisites required for running this program apart from importing the CMakeLists.txt,functionClass2a.c,functionClass2a.h and main2a.c files which are found in the Question2Assignment directory, is the TestingFILE.csv and OutputFile.csv located in the cmake-build-debug folder.

<br />1.CmakeLists.txt is required to run the program
<br /><br />2.functionClass2a.c contains the relevant methods
<br /><br />3.functionClass2a.h contains the declarations for the relevant methods
<br /><br />4.main2a.c contains the test driver 

### Task2b)
The prerequisites required for running this program apart from importing the CMakeLists.txt,functionClass2b.c,functionClass2b.h and main2b.c files which are found in the Question2Assignment directory, is the Testing2.csv and OutputFile.csv located in the cmake-build-debug folder.

<br />1.CmakeLists.txt is required to run the program
<br /><br />2.functionClass2b.c contains the relevant methods
<br /><br />3.functionClass2b.h contains the declarations for the relevant methods
<br /><br />4.main2b.c contains the test driver 

### Task2c)
The prerequisites required for running this program apart from importing the CMakeLists.txt,functionClass2c.c,functionClass2c.h and main2c.c files which are found in the Question2Assignment directory, is the Testing2.csv and OutputFile.csv located in the cmake-build-debug folder.

<br />1.CmakeLists.txt is required to run the program
<br /><br />2.functionClass2c.c contains the relevant methods
<br /><br />3.functionClass2c.h contains the declarations for the relevant methods
<br /><br />4.main2c.c contains the test driver 

<br /><br />The directories .idea and cmake-build-debug are irrelevant if the user is not using CLion as an IDe.
